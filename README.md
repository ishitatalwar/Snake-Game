# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python's Tkinter library.

## Features

- **Gameplay**: Control a snake to eat food and grow longer, while avoiding collisions with walls and the snake's own body.
- **Scoring**: Each time the snake eats food, the player's score increases.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself, displaying a "Game Over" message.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script `snake_game.py`.
2. Use the arrow keys (or optionally, the WASD keys) to control the direction of the snake.
3. The snake will automatically move in the chosen direction.
4. Eat food (red squares) to grow the snake and increase your score.
5. Avoid collisions with walls and the snake's body to survive as long as possible.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library

## Usage

```bash
python snake_game.py



Controls
Arrow keys: Change the direction of the snake (up, down, left, right)
WASD keys (optional): Alternative controls for direction (up, down, left, right)
